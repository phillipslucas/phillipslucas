### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

My name is Lucas Phillips and I am a Masters Student at the University of Tennessee on the Knoxville campus. I graduated with my bachelors degree in environmental studies, geography major and GIS minor in 2016 from Western Washington University. I spent time in the environmental consulting field, freelance jobs, fish exclusion, solar installation, UAV pilot and cadastral data management. I enjoy solving practical problems and use coding to streamline my workflows and spend more time away from the computer.
