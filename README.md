### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

My name is Lucas Phillips and I am a Masters Student at the University of Tennessee on the Knoxville campus. I graduated with my bachelors degree in environmental studies, geography major and GIS minor in 2016 from Western Washington University. After graduation I began a career as a GIS Analyst for Element Soltuions in the envrionmental consulting field working on wetland delineations, geohazard assessments, channel migration zone studies, habitat modelling and investigating any environmental question that crossed my desk. In 2020 I began freelancing as my wife and I prepared for our move to Tennessee from Bellingham, WA. Once in Knoxville I began looking for regular work and settled on a job with S&P Global doing cadastral data entry on contract for the BLM. With some convincing I began inquiring at UT about research opportunities and was awarded a Graduate Teaching Assistanship to do research in the department of Geography and Sustainability. I love geographic applications to problems and find spatial problems fascinating from landslide suceptibility across varried rainfall regimes to mapping housing inequality over time.
